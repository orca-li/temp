    <h2>WHAT</h2>
    <p>This library provides a basic object-oriented (OOP) style API for pointer management. It also offers you
        abstractions and ideas to help you create fast, well-architected code. The philosophy of this library is to
        write a lot of code, to write code quickly, and to write readable code in the C language. The disadvantage of
        this library is the sacrifice of performance in favor of a template, so that you don’t have to think too much.
        The idea of this library is to forgo good algorithms in order to save time.</p>
    <h2>WHY</h2>
    <p>I haven’t written that much code in C, but I’ve constantly struggled with a few things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I wanted to create a massive architecture.</li>
        <li>I wanted to create a flexible architecture.</li>
        <li>I constantly had to think and spend time on it.</li>
        <li>Recurring issues in pointer algorithms.</li>
        <li>I had to write a lot of code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I bought the book “C Programming. Mastery. Principles, Practices and Patterns”, but it mostly talked about good
        code. Good code doesn’t solve the pointer problem. And what names should I give to pointers? After all, we use
        them differently each time. In any case, I didn’t want to bother with algorithms, and at the same time, I wanted
        to write good code. And most of the time, or rather, all of the time, I write code alone. I can’t find my
        minions who would do the dirty work for me. So, this pain has tormented me for a year now.</p>

    <p>The last straw was the FAT32 file system driver, where I constantly worked with pointers, and the code was hard
        to read. In addition, I was faced with byte-ending and tail-chaining problems. I still haven’t found any
        minions, and I will not rewrite code for anything. I want to gain complete control over the computer, and
        refactoring is a waste of time. I wanted code that wouldn’t need refactoring. Observing my pointer algorithms, I
        saw something in them. I saw that pointers in algorithms are counters, and counters are objects. Then I realized
        that pointers are objects. I knew about OOP, but I didn’t know how to apply it in C, or rather, I didn’t
        understand where to apply it. We work with registers, with bits, with bytes, not with objects. Creating a bit
        object is too cumbersome for C. We work with transistors, fans, and interfaces. There’s nowhere to apply OOP,
        it’s very, very cumbersome.</p>

    <h2>HOWTO</h2>
    <p>You can create simple examples that demonstrate the library’s capabilities and its underlying concepts. Also,
        after building the project, you can also generate a book in PDF format.
